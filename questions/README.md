# Quiz Questions Directory

This directory contains all quiz sections as individual JSON files. The app automatically loads all `.json` files from this directory.

## Adding New Quiz Sections

To add a new quiz section:

1. Create a new `.json` file in this directory (e.g., `my-new-section.json`)
2. Follow the JSON structure below
3. The app will automatically detect and load it on the next page refresh

Each JSON file must have the following structure:

```json

  "id": "unique-section-id",
  "title": "Section Title",
